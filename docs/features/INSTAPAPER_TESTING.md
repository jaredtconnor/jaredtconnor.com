# Instapaper Integration Testing Guide

This document provides comprehensive testing procedures for the Instapaper integration.

## Pre-Testing Setup

### 1. Environment Configuration

Ensure these environment variables are set in `apps/cms/.env`:

```bash
INSTAPAPER_CONSUMER_KEY="your-consumer-key"
INSTAPAPER_CONSUMER_SECRET="your-consumer-secret"
DATABASE_URL="your-database-connection"
PAYLOAD_SECRET="your-payload-secret"
```

### 2. Dependencies

Verify all dependencies are installed:

```bash
# From project root
pnpm install

# Check specific packages
cd apps/cms
pnpm list oauth-1.0a metascraper crypto-js
```

### 3. Database Migration

Ensure the bookmarks table exists:

```bash
cd apps/cms
pnpm exec payload migrate
```

  -d '{"username": "valid-user", "password": "valid-pass"}'

# Test invalid authentication
curl -X POST http://localhost:3003/api/instapaper/auth \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"username": "invalid", "password": "invalid"}'

# Check auth status
curl http://localhost:3003/api/instapaper/auth
```

#### Sync Endpoint
```bash
# Test manual sync
curl -X POST http://localhost:3003/api/instapaper/sync \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"limit": 10, "forceRefresh": true}'

# Check sync status
curl http://localhost:3003/api/instapaper/sync
```

#### Individual Bookmark Refresh
```bash
# Test bookmark refresh (replace {id} with actual bookmark ID)
curl -X POST http://localhost:3003/api/bookmarks/{id}/refresh
```

- [ ] Skips invalid bookmarks
- [ ] Reports data validation errors

#### 3. Authentication Errors
- [ ] Handles expired tokens
- [ ] Reports authentication failures
- [ ] Prevents unauthorized access
- [ ] Logs security-related events

### ✅ Performance Testing

#### 1. Sync Performance
- [ ] Large bookmark collections sync efficiently
- [ ] Memory usage stays reasonable
- [ ] Database queries are optimized
- [ ] Metadata extraction doesn't block sync

#### 2. Frontend Performance
- [ ] Bookmark list renders quickly
- [ ] Images load asynchronously
- [ ] No memory leaks in long sessions
- [ ] Good Core Web Vitals scores

### ✅ Security Testing

#### 1. Data Protection
- [ ] API credentials are not exposed
- [ ] No sensitive data in logs
- [ ] Database connections are secure
- [ ] User data is properly isolated

#### 2. Input Validation
- [ ] URL validation prevents XSS
- [ ] API inputs are sanitized
- [ ] Rich text content is safe
- [ ] File uploads (if any) are validated

## Automated Testing

### Unit Tests
Create test files for core services:

```bash
# Run tests (when implemented)
cd apps/cms
pnpm test
```

### Integration Tests
Test API endpoints with real data:

```bash
# Run integration tests
pnpm test:integration
```

### End-to-End Tests
Test complete user workflows:

```bash
# Run e2e tests
pnpm test:e2e
```

## Manual Testing Scenarios

### Scenario 1: First-Time Setup
