## 🏗 Monorepo Structure

This project follows a standard monorepo structure:

- **`apps/`** - Applications (blog frontend)
- **`packages/`** - Shared libraries and UI components
- **`docs/`** - All project documentation
- **`cms/`** - Payload CMS backend
- **`landing/`** - Landing page (Astro)
- **`backend/`** - API backend services

## 📋 How to Use This Documentation

1. **Check Feature Status**: Use `docs/features/README.md` to see implementation status
2. **Find Requirements**: Look in `docs/project-management/master-todo.md` for detailed requirements
3. **Understand Architecture**: Review `docs/features/architecture.md` for system design
4. **Development Tasks**: Check `docs/project-management/master-todo.md` for current priorities

## 🔄 Keeping Documentation Updated

This documentation should be updated whenever:
- New features are implemented
- Architecture decisions are made
- Requirements change
- Integration points are added or modified
